# Looma

**Looma** is the AI assistant that transforms how you organize your life. Take any information—a
sticky note, voice memo, meeting reminder, handwritten list, or simple text—and our AI automatically
organizes everything in the right place, creating your personal intelligent ecosystem that grows
with you.

## Why Looma?

Most productivity apps force you to adapt to their structure. Looma is built for real life: you
capture information naturally, and AI does the organizing. No rigid formats, no complex
workflows—just intelligent assistance that understands your unique style and needs.

## How does it work?

Looma uses advanced AI to understand and organize any type of input you throw at it:

- **📸 Smart Photo Recognition**: Snap photos of handwritten notes, whiteboards, receipts, or
  business cards—Looma reads and organizes everything automatically.
- **🎤 Intelligent Voice Processing**: Speak naturally and watch as "Call mom tomorrow" becomes a
  task reminder, while long voice memos transform into structured notes.
- **⌨️ Natural Language Understanding**: Type as you think—"meeting with John next Tuesday at 3
  PM"—and Looma creates the appropriate actions without rigid syntax.
- **🧠 Conversational AI**: Chat with your assistant like a real person, ask for suggestions, and
  get proactive help that learns your preferences over time.
